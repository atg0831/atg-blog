> This project is a WAS session redundancy solution. It provides an automatic Web Application Server redundancy script based on Docker-compose, so that users do not have to set any special settings for WAS session redundancy. Distributes requests to one web server to two other web application servers. Ensures failover and the continuity of the session on the web application server's unpredictable termination
